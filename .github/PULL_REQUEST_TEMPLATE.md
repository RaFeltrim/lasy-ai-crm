## 👥 Reviewer Guidelines

### For Reviewers

**Response Time:**
- ⏰ **Respond within 1 business day** (even if just acknowledging)
- 💬 First response is more important than complete review

**Communication:**
- 🤝 Be kind and constructive
- 📍 Be precise: "In method X, line Y, rename variable Z to..."
- 🎓 Use reviews as mentoring opportunities
- 🎉 Praise interesting solutions
- 💡 Explain WHY changes are needed, not just WHAT

**What to Avoid:**
- ⚠️ Nitpicking on auto-fixable issues (let linters handle it)
- 🚫 "Looks good to me" without actually reading
- 👥 Herd mentality (review independently)
- 💼 Power dynamics (focus on code, not person)

### For Authors

**Responding to Feedback:**
- 💬 Don't take it personally - "Your code doesn't define you as a person"
- ✍️ Write detailed PR descriptions
- 📦 Submit small, focused PRs (easier to review)
- 🙏 Thank reviewers for their time
- 🤔 Consider all feedback carefully
