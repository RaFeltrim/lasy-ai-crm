# Hydration Error Fix - Complete Solution

## Issue
React hydration error in the dashboard caused by SSR/CSR mismatch:
```
Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching <div> in <div>.
Uncaught Error: Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server.
```

## Root Cause
The [`FiltersBar`](file://c:\Users\Submarino\Desktop\Nova%20pasta\components\leads\FiltersBar.tsx) component was reading from `useSearchParams()` during initial render in the `defaultValues` of `useForm`:

```typescript
// ❌ PROBLEMATIC CODE
const searchParams = useSearchParams()

const { register, handleSubmit, setValue, watch, reset } = useForm<LeadFilter>({
  resolver: zodResolver(LeadFilterSchema),
  defaultValues: {
    query: searchParams.get('query') || '',           // Read during render
    status: (searchParams.get('status') as LeadStatus) || undefined,
    source: searchParams.get('source') || '',
    from: searchParams.get('from') || '',
    to: searchParams.get('to') || '',
  },
})
```

**Why this causes hydration mismatch:**
1. **Server-side**: Renders with URL params from the initial request
2. **Client-side**: May have different URL params or timing issues when hydrating
3. React detects the HTML mismatch and throws hydration error

## Solution (Final Approach)
Use **conditional rendering with mounted state** - don't render the actual form until after client-side hydration completes. Show a loading skeleton during SSR:

### Implementation:
```typescript
'use client'

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'
import { useRouter, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export function FiltersBar() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)

  const { register, handleSubmit, setValue, watch, reset } = useForm<LeadFilter>({
    resolver: zodResolver(LeadFilterSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      query: '',           // ✅ Static defaults
      status: undefined,
      source: '',
      from: '',
      to: '',
    },
  })

  // Sync form with URL params AFTER mount
  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true)
    const query = searchParams.get('query') || ''
    const status = (searchParams.get('status') as LeadStatus) || undefined
    const source = searchParams.get('source') || ''
    const from = searchParams.get('from') || ''
    const to = searchParams.get('to') || ''

    reset({ query, status, source, from, to })
  }, [searchParams, reset])

  // ✅ Don't render form until mounted (prevents hydration mismatch)
  if (!mounted) {
    return (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-6 gap-4">
          <div className="h-10 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded-md lg:col-span-2" />
          <div className="h-10 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded-md" />
          <div className="h-10 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded-md" />
          <div className="h-10 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded-md" />
          <div className="h-10 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded-md" />
        </div>
        <div className="flex gap-2">
          <div className="h-10 w-20 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded-md" />
          <div className="h-10 w-20 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded-md" />
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-4">
      {/* Actual form content */}
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Key Changes in `components/leads/FiltersBar.tsx`

1. **Added imports**:
   ```typescript
   import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
   ```

2. **Added mounted state**:
   ```typescript
   const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)
   ```

3. **Changed defaultValues** to static values (no `searchParams` access)

4. **Added useEffect** to sync form with URL params after mount

5. **Added conditional render** - shows loading skeleton until mounted:
   ```typescript
   if (!mounted) {
     return <LoadingSkeleton />
   }
   ```

## Why This Approach Works Best

### Previous Attempt (Partial Fix)
Initially tried syncing in `useEffect` only, but the form still rendered during SSR with watched values that could cause mismatches.

### Current Solution (Complete Fix)
By **not rendering the form at all** until after mount:
1. ✅ Server renders a simple skeleton (no dynamic content)
2. ✅ Client initially renders the same skeleton (hydration succeeds)
3. ✅ After hydration, `mounted` becomes `true` and form renders with URL params
4. ✅ No SSR/CSR mismatch possible

### Trade-offs
- **Tiny flash of loading skeleton** (usually imperceptible due to fast hydration)
- **Perfect hydration** with zero errors
- **Maintains layout stability** (skeleton matches form dimensions)

## Benefits

✅ **No hydration errors** - Server and client render identical HTML initially
✅ **Preserves functionality** - Form still syncs with URL params after mount
✅ **Better performance** - React doesn't need to force client-side re-render
✅ **Follows best practices** - Adheres to Next.js SSR hydration guidelines

## Related Fixes

This is part of a series of hydration fixes in the CRM:

1. **DashboardClient** ([CRITICAL_PATCH.md](file://c:\Users\Submarino\Desktop\Nova%20pasta\CRITICAL_PATCH.md)) - Fixed `window.location` access in export handlers
2. **FiltersBar** (this fix) - Fixed `searchParams` access in form defaultValues

## Testing
After this fix:
- ✅ No console errors on page load
- ✅ Filters properly sync with URL params
- ✅ Drag-and-drop working (confirmed by successful PUT requests)
- ✅ Form submission and reset working correctly

## Memory Update
This fix reinforces the hydration error prevention pattern documented in project memory:
> "Avoid using client-side APIs (e.g., window, localStorage) directly in component render logic. Instead, initialize state with default values and update within useEffect to ensure server and client renders match initially."

**Extended to include:** `useSearchParams()` should also be avoided in initial render/defaultValues.
