## üìñ For AI Assistants (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude)

This documentation was specifically created to provide complete context for AI assistants working on this codebase. Key points:

### Project Journey
We started with a clean Next.js 14 setup and encountered **7 critical bugs** during development. Each bug taught us important lessons about:
- React 18 hydration and SSR/CSR mismatches
- Supabase RLS and PostgREST schema cache behavior
- @dnd-kit collision detection and touch sensors
- Mobile-first design patterns

### What Makes This Project Special
1. **No Assumptions**: We document exact versions, exact code, exact errors
2. **Complete History**: Every bug, every fix, every decision is documented
3. **Visual Guides**: Flowcharts show system behavior at a glance
4. **Practical Examples**: Real code snippets you can copy-paste

### How to Use This Documentation
1. Start with [02-ARCHITECTURE.md](./02-ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the tech stack
2. Review [06-BUGS-AND-FIXES.md](./06-BUGS-AND-FIXES.md) to learn from our mistakes
3. Use [07-HOW-TO-GUIDES.md](./07-HOW-TO-GUIDES.md) for common tasks
4. Reference [08-FLOWCHARTS.md](./08-FLOWCHARTS.md) to visualize system behavior
